# RuntasticPro Xposed module

This is an [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer) module that re-enables some Pro features that you used to get when you paid for the app on the Play store, but after Adidas brought the app made them require a monthly subscription.

Features that are enabled are:
* Split distances other than 1KM for the activity pace breakdown
* Showing the Max. Elevation & Dehydration on the activity summary
* Viewing the activity history by frequencies other than 1 month
